# Contributing to Polymvthic Resources

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This resource list is curated to maintain a specific polymathic philosophy‚Äîwe're not just aggregating tools, we're building a cognitive fingerprint.

## üéØ What We're Looking For

**Good contributions:**
- ‚úÖ Tools/books you've actually used and can vouch for
- ‚úÖ Resources that span multiple domains (privacy + creativity, hacking + philosophy)
- ‚úÖ Alternatives that offer genuine improvements over existing listings
- ‚úÖ Niche tools that serve a specific polymathic use case

**We'll probably reject:**
- ‚ùå Generic "top 10" recommendations you haven't personally tested
- ‚ùå Redundant tools that don't meaningfully differ from what's listed
- ‚ùå Purely commercial products without free/open alternatives mentioned
- ‚ùå Resources that only serve one narrow domain without broader application
- ‚ùå Anything that conflicts with our privacy-first, freedom-focused ethos

## üß† Our Curation Philosophy

This isn't a comprehensive list‚Äîit's a *curated* one. Here's what we optimize for:

### **1. Polymathic Range**
Does it serve multiple domains? A tool that's both privacy-focused AND creative gets bonus points.

### **2. Battle-Tested**
We only list things we've actually used. If you're suggesting something, we expect you have too.

### **3. Signal Over Noise**
10 great tools beats 100 mediocre ones. Quality > quantity.

### **4. Practical Privacy**
We value privacy but aren't dogmatic. Discord is here alongside Session because real-world workflows matter.

### **5. Freedom-Focused**
Open-source is preferred, but we'll list proprietary if it's genuinely the best tool for the job.

## ‚úÖ Contribution Checklist

Before submitting, ask yourself:

- [ ] Have I personally used this tool/read this book?
- [ ] Does it fit the polymathic philosophy (multi-domain, not single-purpose)?
- [ ] Is it already listed? (Check carefully!)
- [ ] Does it align with privacy/freedom values?
- [ ] Can I explain *why* this belongs here in 1-2 sentences?

## üö´ What We Don't Accept

- **Spam or self-promotion** (unless you built something genuinely useful)
- **Affiliate links** (we handle those ourselves)
- **Tools with sketchy privacy practices** (no data-harvesting BS)
- **Books that don't add intellectual value** (no fluff, no pop-business garbage)
- **Anything illegal or unethical** (we're hackers, not criminals)

---

## üîÑ Review Process

1. **We review all contributions** within 1-2 weeks
2. **We'll ask questions** if we need clarification
3. **We maintain editorial control** to preserve quality
4. **You'll be credited** in commits if your suggestion is accepted

Remember: rejection isn't personal. We're optimizing for a specific polymathic vision, and not everything fits‚Äîeven if it's a great tool.
